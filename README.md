PID Heating Control

This Python code provides a basic implementation of a heating control system using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller and a MAX31865 RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) amplifier. The code is designed to be used with a hardware setup that includes a heating element, a temperature sensor, and a microcontroller board (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

Installation

To use this code, you will need to install the following libraries:

adafruit-circuitpython-max31865: This library provides support for the MAX31865 RTD amplifier.
python-pid: This library provides support for the PID controller algorithm.
You can install these libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install adafruit-circuitpython-max31865 python-pid
Usage

To use this code, you will need to modify the apply_control_signal function to apply the control signal to your specific heating element. You can also adjust the PID gains (kp, ki, kd) and the desired setpoint temperature (setpoint) to suit your specific application.

Once you have made any necessary modifications, you can run the pid_heating_control.py script:

Copy code
python pid_heating_control.py
The script will read temperature values from the MAX31865 amplifier, compute a control signal using the PID algorithm, and apply the control signal to the heating element to maintain the desired setpoint temperature.
