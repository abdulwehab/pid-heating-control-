# pid-heating-control-
Python code for controlling a heating system using a PID controller and a MAX31865 RTD amplifier. This code reads temperature values from the amplifier, computes a control signal using the PID algorithm, and applies the control signal to the heating element to maintain a desired setpoint temperature
